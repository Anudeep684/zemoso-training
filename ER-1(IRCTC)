1)Design a database schema for railway ticket booking using the E-R model and 
design tables accordingly using the relationship model.
The necessary information is given below :

Entities : Train, Ticket, Customer
Ticket can be reserved or unreserved.
Each reserved ticket must correspond to a train and a customer.
Each unreserved ticket must correspond to a customer.
A customer cannot be in two trains at the same time.
Assume columns accordingly and mention primary keys, weak and strong entities.

Based on the given information, we can design a database schema for railway ticket booking 
using the Entity-Relationship (E-R) model. 
Here's the schema along with the necessary tables:

Entities:
1. Train
2. Ticket
3. Customer

Primary Keys:
1. Train_ID (Primary Key for Train)
2. Ticket_ID (Primary Key for Ticket)
3. Customer_ID (Primary Key for Customer)

Strong Entity:
1. Train
2. Customer

Weak Entity:
1. Ticket

Attributes:
Train (Train_ID, Train_Name, Start_Station, End_Station, ...)
Ticket (Ticket_ID, Ticket_Type, Price, ...)
Customer (Customer_ID, Customer_Name, Email, Phone_Number, ...)

Relationships:
1. Each reserved ticket must correspond to a train and a customer.
   - Reserve (Ticket_ID, Train_ID, Customer_ID)
2. Each unreserved ticket must correspond to a customer.
   - Unreserve (Ticket_ID, Customer_ID)
3. A customer cannot be in two trains at the same time.
   - Book (Customer_ID, Train_ID)

Table Designs:

Train Table:
Train_ID (Primary Key)
Train_Name
Start_Station
End_Station
... (Other train-related attributes)

Ticket Table:
Ticket_ID (Primary Key)
Ticket_Type
Price
... (Other ticket-related attributes)

Customer Table:
Customer_ID (Primary Key)
Customer_Name
Email
Phone_Number
... (Other customer-related attributes)

Relationship Tables:

Reserve Table:
Ticket_ID (Foreign Key referencing Ticket.Ticket_ID)
Train_ID (Foreign Key referencing Train.Train_ID)
Customer_ID (Foreign Key referencing Customer.Customer_ID)

Unreserve Table:
Ticket_ID (Foreign Key referencing Ticket.Ticket_ID)
Customer_ID (Foreign Key referencing Customer.Customer_ID)

Book Table:
Customer_ID (Foreign Key referencing Customer.Customer_ID)
Train_ID (Foreign Key referencing Train.Train_ID)
